# Django-Blog

I have made blog project using django in backend and frontend using html css javascript and bootstrap.

1. I have added a functionalities like 'Like', 'Comment', 'Reply to comment', Search Blogs,  'Blog Categories', 'Create Blog', 'Update Blog', 'Delete Blog', and offcourse authentication !.
2. Geust User can read all of the blogs and comments and their replies but cannot create, update or delete a blog, cannot comment/reply on it and also cannot like the blog posts.
3. User can perform all of the fuctionalities mentioned in point no 1.
4. I learned alot of new concepts in django while building these project.
